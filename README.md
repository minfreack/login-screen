# React + TypeScript + Vite

Hi I developed with these tools because tailwind it's a CSS Framework that I know from several projects so I can design really fast given my experience. Also I use vite because is more faster than webpack. I know that I have just one hour so I decided to use technologies with which I am familiar.
